 * 1. browser send's the request(either static or dynamic)
 * 2. server accepts the request and identify whether request is for static response or dynamic response
 * 3. if request if for static resource -server responds back with copy of static resource
 * 4. if request if for static resource and server doesn't have the required resource it will generate 404-page not found error
 * 5. if request if for dynamic response, then server will identify for that request which .java code to be executed.
 * 6. to identify which .java file(servlet/resource) will be used to response back we use "web.xml/annotations".
 * 7. Once the required resource is available then server will handover the control to "Container"/servlets.
 * 8. container will now execute the .java code based on it's "life cycle - actions".
